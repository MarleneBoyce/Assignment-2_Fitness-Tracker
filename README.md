The Fitness Tracker C# GUI App mimics a Workout Log. The user enters their daily workouts into a text file. The app allows the user to view all texts file within the app, and it also allows the user to search for a range of workouts. The display outputs the workouts the user requested, plus the total workout time, total calories burned, and total workouts logged.
